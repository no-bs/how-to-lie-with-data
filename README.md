# How to lie with data.
A short instruction for busy professionals




## 1. Why you are bound to lie if you are dealing with data?
The answer is very simple: money! You need to be paid after the 'presentation of results' which involves data in an appealing form or you need to ignite an 'irrational exuberance' and an unreasonable expectation (of your future performance in the job) in a person who is about to give you money, position or something else of apparent value in advance. In both cases the adjectives suggest at least some degree of misunderstanding of reality (and deception on your part) necessary for the 'optimization' of your monetary outcome.

In case you (as it happens) never thought how much data you will need for a _reliable_ conclusion, remember the combination of words __"the curse of dimensionality"__

You will lie because there wasn't enough money for doing an exaustive research or because if you explain the degree of improbability that your unexpected hypothesis has to turn out to be true nobody in his right mind will give you a dime, ever. Don't worry too much, it's been like that before with pretty much all the amazing achievements of the humankind.

## 2. A useless comparison with data liars of the past.
Lying with data is not new, it has been practiced for millenia by representatives of 'learned professions' in human societies of the past. Typically they were relatively well paid (see above) which served very well the purpose of development of branches of science and more granular methods of lies applicable only in particular classes of phenomena. But in general those were:
### Treasurers and Accountants! 
Since the times of the biblical kings and even before them the treasurers were responsible for developing and mastering the skill of 'creative accounting' which is probably the first example of lying in numeric format. The numerous number systems served the purpose of deception better than a single one, some researchers insist that these numeric excersizes were a prototype for the business method of 'secrecy' practiced by the War Physicists' of the XX-th century (see below).
### Astrologists! 
The beauty of their business method is in its obviousness. The planets and the stars can be seen in the sky, they visibly 'move', at the same time things keep happening on Earth. It's 'obvious' that there is a _hidden_ connection between the two and the 'wise people' who know it just have to be... paid well for disclosing it to the rich and powerful people of Earth (of course!).
### Alchemists! 
These are the original inventors of the 'quantitative lies' that will be described in full below. Notice the important aspect of their business-method - they were lying in order to sustain an endless 'research' phase of the project; that's why it required _more data_ , so, that there would be a constant proof of 'progress' justifying the spending (on the alchemists salary and equipment).
### War physicists! 
This is an example of constant lie through secrecy and it is mostly based on a conspiracy theory that 'the opponent' _already has_ done or achieved something or is in the middle of doing that. In any case the obtained results are so secret that only a handful of people (most of them are congenital stupids wearing epaulettes) can be allowed to even know about their existence.
### 'Technicagl Analysis' specialists.
Since its inception in the dark ages of tulip speculation in the West and rice speculation in the East 'technical analysis' became a useful instrument for untruthfull individuals all around the world. It makes it 'obvious' what investment decision you are supposed to make. Of course there is always a conjugate set of 'indicators' telling you the opposite.
### 'Data Scientists'.
This is a largely still emerging group of individuals absorbing the methods of the craft and enriching them with completely new inventions, such as intentionally complex 'pre-processing' algorithms introducing largely untraceable transformations into the available data set which make it biased towards a particular algorithm of processing that particular 'data scientist' knows how to use. The complete behavioral research of the species 'data scientist' can be found in Appendix D.S.

## 3. An exaustive list of methods of lies involving data.

As with any information there are pretty much two main methods of lies: to withold information altogeter and to distort it. So, the complete list must have two main sections: 

### I.  Lying by not telling about the existence of data.
This is the simplest method. Just dont' tell _anybody_. The more sophisticated version of the method involves actual destruction of all the records about the data. Pull out the pages of your lab journal with the series of measurements that you don't like, tear them apart, burn in a stove, take the ashes outside the building and let the wind blow them away... and forget about them. But don't forget to erase the files, delete all the intermediary results that had shown how contradictory is this particular data set for the case that you are about to make in your  presentation... The version for researchers in government is to classify not only the data itself, not only the fact that it has been obtained, but the very fact that you (of anybody else for that matter) knew that it ever existed. And that can be done, believe me!

### II.  Lying by distorting the data.
There are three main methods of distortion: 
```
1. exclude a part of the data (sampling, 'bootstrap', 'exclusion of outliers');
2. add fictional data to your data (imputation, interpolation, other versions of 'pull-out-of-your-ass' method); 
3. and, finally, you can nudge the individual points in the direction of values that make your model work (arbitrary scaling, in physics - 'renormalization' or 'calibration').
```

##  How to do your homework?
As I said earlier there is a sea of combinations of the main methods, described above, and it's up to your creativity where to steal your methods from. Google and Elsevier are the best sources for your research, but any shelf of contemporary scientific periodicals will give you enough material for developing your skill enough. You will not regret that you've spent some time looking with the eye of a _real_ researcher at the half-baked publications written by a student in a sleepless night before the deadline. When you are done with periodicals, start reading the works of Nobel prize winners. You will see many similarities but there will be one distinction - their works crystallize around some theme that gradually becomes _acceptable_ for the rest of the scientific community and will ultimately win them some __money__ (see paragraph 1).
