# How to lie with data.
A short instruction for busy professionals



## 1. Why you are bound to lie if you are dealing with data?
The answer is very simple: money! You need to be paid after the 'presentation of results' which involves data in an appealing form or you need to ignite an 'irrational exuberance' and an unreasonable expectation (of your future performance in the job) in a person who is about to give you money in advance. In both cases the adjectives suggest at least some degree of deception necessary for the 'optimization' of your monetary outcome.

## 2. A useless comparison with data liars of the past.
Lying with data is not new, it has been practiced for millenia by representative of 'learned professions' in human societies of the past. Typically they were well paid (see above) which served very well the purpose of development of branches of science and more granular methods of lies applicable only in particular classes of cases. But in general those were:
### Accountants! 
Since the times of the biblical kings and even before them the treasurers were responsible for developing and mastering the skill of 'creative accounting' which is probably the first example of lying in numeric format. The numerous number systems served the purpose of deception better than a single one, some researchers insist that these numeric excersizes were a prototype for the business method of 'secrecy' practiced by the War Physicists' of the XX-th century (see below).
### Astrologists! 
The beauty of their business method is in its obviousness. The planets and the stars can be seen in the sky, they visibly 'move', at the same time things keep happening on Earth. It's 'obvious' that there is a _hidden_ connection between the two and the 'wise people' who know it just have to be... paid well for disclosing it to the rich and powerful people of Earth (of course!).
### Alchemists! 
These are the original inventors of the 'quantitative lies' that will be described in full below. Notice the important aspect of their business-method - they were lying in order to sustain an endless 'research' phase of the project; that's why it required _more data_ , so, that there would be a constant proof of 'progress' justifying the spending (on the alchemists salary and equipment).
### War physicists! 
This is an example of constant lie through secrecy and it is mostly based on a conspiracy theory that 'the opponent' _already has_ done or achieved something or is in the middle of doing that. In any case the obtained results are so secret that only a handful of people (most of them are congenital stupids wearing epaulettes) can be allowed to even know about their existence.

## 3. An exaustive list of methods of lies involving data.

As with any information there are pretty much two main methods of lies: to withold information altogeter and to distort it. There is a sea of combinations and it's up to your creativity where to steal your methods from.
