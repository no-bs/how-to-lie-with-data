# How to lie with data.
A short instruction for busy professionals

## 1. Why you are bound to lie if you are dealing with data?
The answer is very simple: money! You need to be paid after the 'presentation of results' which involves the data in an appealing form or you need to ignite an unreasonable expectation in a person who is about to give you money in advance. In both cases the adjectives suggest at least some degree of deception necessary for the 'optimization' of your monetary outcome.

## 2. A useless comparison with data liars of the past.

### Accountants! 
Since the times of the biblical kings and even before them the treasurers were responsible for developing and mastering the skill of 'creative accounting'.
### Astrologists! 
The beauty of their business method is in the obviousness. The planets and the stars 'move' in the sky, at the same time things keep happening on our Earth. It's 'obvious' that there is a --hidden-- connection between the two and the 'wise people' who know it just have to be... paid well for disclosing it to the rich and powerful people of Earth.
### Alchemists! 
These are the original inventors of the 'quantitative lies' that will be described in full below. Notice the important aspect of their business-method - they were lying in order to sustain an endless 'research' phase of the project; that's why it required --more data-- , so, that there would be a constant proof of 'progress' justifying the spending (on the alchemists salary and equipment).
### War physicists! 
This is an example of constant lie through secrecy and it is mostly based on a conspiracy theory that 'the opponent' --already has-- done or achieved something or is in the middle of doing that. In any case the obtained results are so secret that only a handful of people (most of them are congenital stupids wearing epaulettes) can be allowed to even know about their existence.

## 3. An exaustive list of methods of lies involving data.

As with any information there are pretty much two main methods of lies: to withold information altogeter and to distort it. There is a sea of combinations and it's up to your creativity where to steal your methods from.
